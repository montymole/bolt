# Bolting it together

This is just something I use myself, fuck you if you don't like it.

## We want

* Blazing speed
* Simplicity
* Ease of use
    * change model autoupdate view(s)

## We don't want

* any massive library requirements
* complicated framework
* jquery or such
* requirejs or such
 
## and we don't care about

 old browser support (old Internet Explorers)

## Features

* gulp generated and minified templates
* simple Bolt object to tie model, template and dom-element together

## a little more to come
